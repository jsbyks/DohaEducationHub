Tasks:
- Deploy frontend (Vercel) and backend (Railway/Render). Point domain to staging. 🔄 (Blocked by deployment and environment)
- Invite 20-50 beta users (parents/teachers) for testing. 🔄 (Blocked by deployment)

- Sprint retrospective and roadmap update for next phase (teacher marketplace). ✅ (Documentation updated)

Deliverables:
- Publicly accessible MVP (soft launch) and feedback log. 🔄 (Blocked by deployment)
- Post-launch backlog and prioritized fixes. ✅

Acceptance Criteria:

### Ongoing / Cross-cutting Tasks (run each week)
- Daily bug triage and short standup.
- Weekly demo to stakeholders.
- Security & backups: basic env secrets and daily DB backups.
- Analytics: basic GA/analytics setup and tracking events for search and profile views.

---

### Notes & Next Steps
- The MVP code is now considered largely feature-complete based on the sprint backlog. Further progress requires deployment, resolving backend CORS issues, and running comprehensive E2E tests.
- After Week 8, prioritize teacher marketplace, booking, payments, and advanced AI components (semantic search, content automation).
- If you want, I can scaffold the repo and create starter templates for Weeks 1–4 next.
