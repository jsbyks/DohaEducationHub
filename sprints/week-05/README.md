- Allow users to register, save favorites, and post verified reviews (minimal flow).

Tasks:
- Frontend auth flows (signup/login/logout) with session handling.
- Favorites (save school) feature for logged-in users.

- Simple CMS for blog posts (create, edit, publish) via admin API.

Deliverables:
- User account flows working end-to-end.
- Review submission pipeline with admin moderation flag.
- CMS endpoints for blog posts.

Acceptance Criteria:
