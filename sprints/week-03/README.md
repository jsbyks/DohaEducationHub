Week 3 — School Directory API + Admin CRUD (2025-12-29 → 2026-01-04)

Objectives:
- Build core API for schools and admin CRUD.

Tasks:
- Schools CRUD endpoints: list, detail, create, update, delete.
- Implement filtering: location (city/district), curriculum, fee range, school type.
- Admin-only routes protected by role checks.
- Add basic validation (Pydantic schemas).

Deliverables:
- API docs (OpenAPI) with schools endpoints.
- Admin CRUD working via API client (Postman collection).

Acceptance Criteria:
- API responses match schema and filters work.
- Admin can create/update a school and changes persist.
